## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack blogging platform I built called "DailyThoughts". The goal was to create a complete web application from scratch where users can sign up, create and manage their own blog posts, and view profiles of other users. I built it using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and implemented all the essential features like user authentication and full CRUD functionality for posts. I also implemented a bonus search feature to make the app more dynamic.
