## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack blogging platform I built called "DailyThoughts". The goal was to create a complete web application from scratch where users can sign up, create and manage their own blog posts, and view profiles of other users. I built it using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and implemented all the essential features like user authentication and full CRUD functionality for posts. I also implemented a bonus search feature to make the app more dynamic.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

If you'd like to run this project on your own machine, here‚Äôs how to do it.

**1. Get the Code**
First, clone the repository to your computer:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/NaveenCK-10/DailyThoughts-blog-app.git](https://github.com/NaveenCK-10/DailyThoughts-blog-app.git)
cd DailyThoughts-blog-app

# Go into the backend folder
cd backend

# Install the necessary packages
npm install

You'll also need to create a .env file in the /backend folder. It just needs two things:

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_for_tokens

Once that's done, you can start the server:
node server.js

3. Set Up the Frontend
# In a new terminal, go into the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install the necessary packages
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

The app should now be running in your browser!
